# Robust statistical inferences using the bootstrap (PSYCH4091)

## Description

The bootstrap is a statistical method that uses data-driven simulations to make inferences.
This course provides a general and practical introduction to the bootstrap, with very little mathematics.
Examples include applications to popular psychological inference problems.

## Aims

The aim of this course is to introduce students to the bootstrap and how it can be used to make statistical inferences.
The course teaches practical R skills including how to run simulations, implement the bootstrap, illustrate results in ggplot2 and make reproducible reports using Rmarkdown. Practical applications include inferences about group comparisons and correlation analyses.

## ILOs (intended learning outcomes)

By the end of this course students will be able to:

-	Explain the goal and implementation of the percentile bootstrap at an abstract level.
-	Interact with and write R code implementing the percentile bootstrap.
-	Apply the bootstrap to inferences on measures of central tendency and correlations.
-	Illustrate raw data and bootstrap results using ggplot2.
-	Use the percentile bootstrap to make statistical inferences and interpret the results, including the description of p values and confidence intervals.
-	Write reproducible reports using RMarkdown.

The slides for all sessions are hosted on [Moodle](https://moodle.gla.ac.uk/login/index.php). They will be available on [figshare]() later on for external users.
