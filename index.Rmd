# Robust statistical inferences using the bootstrap (PSYCH4091)

## Description

The bootstrap is a statistical method that uses data-driven simulations to make inferences.
This course provides a general and practical introduction to the bootstrap, with very little mathematics.
Examples include applications to popular psychological inference problems.

## Aims

The aim of this course is to introduce students to the bootstrap and how it can be used to make statistical inferences.
The course teaches practical R skills including how to run simulations, implement the bootstrap, illustrate results in ggplot2 and make reproducible reports using Rmarkdown. Practical applications include inferences about group comparisons and correlation analyses.

## ILOs (intended learning outcomes)

By the end of this course students will be able to:

-	Explain the goal and implementation of the percentile bootstrap at an abstract level.
-	Interact with and write R code implementing the percentile bootstrap.
-	Apply the bootstrap to inferences on measures of central tendency and correlations.
-	Illustrate raw data and bootstrap results using ggplot2.
-	Use the percentile bootstrap to make statistical inferences and interpret the results, including the description of p values and confidence intervals.
-	Write reproducible reports using RMarkdown.

The slides for all sessions are hosted on [Moodle](https://moodle.gla.ac.uk/login/index.php). They will be available on [figshare]() later on for external users.

## Lecture 3: Robust estimation

ILOs: 
- describe distributions by referring to their skewness, kurtosis and the presence of outliers;
- explain why we need robust estimators;
- define trimmed means and explain their advantages;
- explain the imapct of outliers and skewness on estimation and statistical inferences;
- describe why classic outlier detection methods are not robust and the foundation of alternative robust methods;
- use R functions to detect outliers;
- use R to perform inferential statistics on the median and on trimmed means.

## Lecture 4: Sampling distributions

ILOs: 
- define sampling distribution and standard error;
- given a population, compute and illustrate a sampling distribution in R;
- decribe the relationship between sampling distributions and bootstrap distributions;
- explain the usefulness of simulating sampling distributions.

## Lecture 5: Bootstrap-t

ILOs: 
- Explain the bootstrap-t and its implementation.
- In R, use functions implementing the bootstrap-t for one group, two independent groups and two dependent groups.

## Lecture 6: Correlation

ILOs: 
- Describe some of the critical problems with Pearson's correlation.
